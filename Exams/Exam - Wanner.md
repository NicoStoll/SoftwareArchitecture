# Exercise 3 (12 Points)

## Explain the topics 'Architecture Description', 'Concern', 'Architecture Viewpoint', 'Architecture View', 'Model Kind' and 'Architecture Model' and their relationships from the following picture (ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011)


![[IEEE_42010_2011.png]]
**Architecture Description**: a collection of artifacts that document the architecture of a system. It includes architecture views, architecture viewpoints, ...
**Concern**: . Concerns arise throughout the life cycle from system needs and requirements, from design choices and from implementation and operating considerations. A concern could be manifest in many forms, such as in relation to one or more stakeholder needs, goals, expectations, responsibilities, requirements, design constraints, assumptions, dependencies, quality attributes, architecture decisions, risks or other issues pertaining to the system.
**Architecture Views**: Addresses one or more of the concerns held by the system's stakeholders. The architecture view expresses the architecture of the system-of-interest in accordance with an architecture viewpoint.
**Architecture Viewpoints**: A specification of a whole system from the perspective of a related set of concerns. It defines the stakeholders, concerns and model kinds.
**Architecture Model**: An architecture model consists of one or more architecture models. An architecture model uses modelling conventions appropriate to the concerns to be addressed. These conventions are specified by the model kind governing a model.
