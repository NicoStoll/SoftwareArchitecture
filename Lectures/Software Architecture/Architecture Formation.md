- Architecture design is an iterative process!
- **Initially** - analyze requirements, design a high level architecture
- **Refine software architecture in iterations** - analyze requirements in more detail, consider feedback, extend software architecture
- **Quantify requirements whenever possible, e.g.**
	- Mean Time Between Between Failure (MTBF)
	- Average response time, load behavior, scalability

### Is there a industry-standard approach?
No there is many industry approaches: **ADD, S4V, RUP 4 + 1, BAPO, ASC**
What so they have in common?
