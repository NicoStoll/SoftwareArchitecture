- Architecture design is an iterative process!
- **Initially** - analyze requirements, design a high level architecture
- **Refine software architecture in iterations** - analyze requirements in more detail, consider feedback, extend software architecture
- **Quantify requirements whenever possible, e.g.**
	- Mean Time Between Between Failure (MTBF)
	- Average response time, load behavior, scalability
