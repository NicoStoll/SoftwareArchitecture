### Principles of Good Architecture
1. **useful:** fulfill functional and quality requirements
2. **stable:** reliable, mature, maintainable
3. **graceful:** well-structured design, great UX

**Good Software Architecture**
- Creates a meaningful division of components (Abstraction from complex details: [[Principles]], Isolate [[Cross-Cutting Concerns]] )
- Shows that functional and quality [[Requirements]] will or can be fulfilled over the entire system
- Helps the stakeholders understand the system
- Specifies necessary implementation measures
- Defined design guidelines to ensure conceptual integrity
- Documents and provides rationale for design decision
