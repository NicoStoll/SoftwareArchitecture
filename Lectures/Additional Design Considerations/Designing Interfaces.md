**Interfaces**
- define the **relationship** between components
- define the **structure** and **behavior** of the system
- connection to the outside world

Interfaces must fulfill user (mostly consumer) requirements
- suitable functionality (difficult for public APIs)
- Easy to learn and use
	- Provide **IDL** (e.g. Swagger)
	- Use unit tests as documentation
- Easy to extend
	- Consider API versioning
- Hard to misuse (intentional and unintentional)
- Consistent to other interfaces in the system


### Best Practices
- use it yourself, implement tests and use the tests as a reference example
- clarify requirements with the customer and provider
- hide implementation details (information hiding principle)
- use meaningful, self-descriptive names
- minimize surprises and side effects (**principle of least surprise**)
- provide **atomic** information units
- documentation (especially for boundary/threshold example and errors)
