### **Abstractness** of a package
= ratio of the number of **abstract classes** in the analyzed package **to the total number of classes** in the package

$$A=\frac{Classes_{abstract}}{Classes_{total}}$$



A = 0 --> completely concrete package
A = 1 --> completely abstract package

### **Instability** 
= indicator of the package's resilience to change
$$A=\frac{f{out}}{f_{out} + f_{in}}$$
