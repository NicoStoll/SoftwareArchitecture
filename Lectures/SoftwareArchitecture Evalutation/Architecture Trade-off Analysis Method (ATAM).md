- **Pre-Development**: Analysis with ATAM
	- determine if the architecture meets project requirements
	- uncover potential risks through structured analysis
- **(Pre-)Development Phase**: Risk Evaluation with Prototyping
	- Critical parts identification by developing and testing key parts
	- Risk identification by simulating real-world scenarios
- **(Post-)Development:** Ensuring quality with scenarios and metrics
	- verify quality objectives through predefined scenarios
	- evaluate and compare against established standards or historical data

**Quality scenario-based assessment** identifying
- possible system usages
- architecture decisions regarding quality goals
- quality criteria
--> understanding of architectural impacts on system quality

### Phases

#### Phase 0: Preparation
- Gather analysis team
- connect with development team
- plan and organize the workshop

#### Phase 1: Architecture-based analysis
- present ATAM
- present business drivers
- present architecture
- identify architecture approaches
- generate quality tree (including scenarios)
- analysis of architectural approaches

#### Hiatus between Phase 1 and 2
- collaboration between architecture and evaluation teams
- gain insights into the architecture
- build rudimentary models for phase 2 preparation
- set up final evaluation team for phase 2

#### Phase 2: Stakeholder-based analysis
- brainstorming and prioritization of scenarios
- analysis of architectural approaches
- presentation of the results

#### Phase 3: Post-Processing
- collect and document results
- plan follow-up
- refine process
