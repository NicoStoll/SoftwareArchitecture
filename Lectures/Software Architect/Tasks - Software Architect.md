## Establish a business Case:
IT project  should be based on a business case 
- consider **expected costs** and **desired benefits**
- business value from **customer perspective**
Create and elaborate **economically viable solutions**, shape and constrain **future requirements**.

## Clarify Requirements
Identify, gather, clarify, refine and scrutinize 
- **functional requirements** (required features)
- **quality characteristics** (leading to required constraints)
- **influencing factors** (business context, stakeholders)
(see [[Requirements]])
Analyze feasibility, identify **contradictions**

## Design/Select the System's Software Architecture
Select potential architectures from existing solutions
- Compare **cost and benefits**
- consider **integration** with existing solutions and systems
- align design with existing systems' architecture
- develop alternative or extended designs
Choose technologies:
- Reuse **proven frameworks, libraries and components**
- consider developers experience
Design the system and thereby its architecture
- Decompose into building blocks (domain layer, technology layer)
- Define **dependencies and interfaces**
- Decide on cross-cutting concerns

## Document  + Communicate Software Architecture
Create shared understanding via:
- Conceptualization and illustrative representations
- Depictions of functionality and technical elements
Document and communicate software architecture based on
- **views**
- **architectural patterns**
- **cross-cutting concerns**
**Always explicitly specify assumptions and prerequisites!**

## Guide + Support Implementation
Support realization and implementation of the architecture
- Ensure **compliance of implementation** with the systems software architecture
- integrate **feedback** from relevant stakeholder

## Evaluate Architecture
