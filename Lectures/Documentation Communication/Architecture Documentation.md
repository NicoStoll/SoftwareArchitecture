### Why Architecture Documentation
--> document what can not be found in the source code
#### Documentation
- System overview
- Architectural/Technology decisions
- Rationale for decisions
- Cross-cutting concerns
- Error/Problem locating
- Adapt to change

### Basic / Additional Documentation
--> **high risk === more extensive documentation**

| Basic                                                                                   | Additional                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structure and interaction of Building blocks \| Source code \| Technical infrastructure | Detailing above aspects                                   |
| Basic assumptions, decisions, technologies, and concepts                                | For developers \| administrators \| managers \| customers |

### Best Practices
- **Tailor content** to the reader's knowledge level and needs
- be clear and concise: simple language, no jargon, short sentences, no repetition
- Clear structure and flow, headings, subheadings and bullet points
- prefer active voice over passive
- use examples to illustrate complex concepts
- use **diagrams, tables and screenshots** to complement text
- Maintain **consistency** in terminology, formatting and style
- Keep documentation **current**
- use appropriate tools: **style guides, grammar checkers, templates ([[arc42]])**
