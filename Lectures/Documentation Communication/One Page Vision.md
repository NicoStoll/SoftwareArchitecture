A one-page vision of the system, describing:
- Major **tasks and domain** elements
	- 2-3 sentences
	- use domain terms
	- list the five most important domain terms
- Usage and **users** of the system
	- What ==type of usage== should be achieved? (may be more than one)
		- **interactive & operational** - transform current data, highly available and performance
		- **decision support** - read/evaluate current data, lower availability and performance
		- **batch** - pre- or post-processing, interaction with other systems
		- **embedded** - hardware integration
		- **real-time** - guaranteed execution times
	- Stakeholders
		- Users
		- Negative stakeholders
- **UI** and **system interface**
	- ==UI==
		- form-based /object-oriented / command-line /special devices
		- adaptable to experience /user groups
		- installer /user
	- ==System interface==
		- to/from other systems, performance, stability changeability
		- data-interface
		- functional interface: (a)synchronous, definition, fault-tolerance
- **Data access** and organization (storing data in ...)
	- main memory
	- files
	- DBMS
- System **control** (ways to control the system)
	- **procedural** - a main component controls a sequential flow, minimal user interaction
	- **event driven** - GUI, client/server, feedback control systems
	- **parallel** - independent interacting components
	- **rule-based** - rules executed by a rule-engine
- Static Context: most abstract, top level --> Context view [[iSAQB-Views]]
- **static Top-down refinements**
