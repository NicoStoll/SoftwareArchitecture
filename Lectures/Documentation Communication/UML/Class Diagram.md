**Aggregation:** Aggregation is a weak association relationship. It represents a "has-a" relationship where the lifetime of the part (child) is independent of the whole (parent). 

**Composition:** Composition is a strong association relationship. It represents a "contains-a" relationship where the lifetime of the part (child) is strictly dependent on the whole (parent).
