### Architectural Uncertainty
- inherent uncertainty in requirements - vague/ambiguous, changing
- Architects can manage this by
	- Providing and regularly getting stakeholders feedback
	- Making decisions iteratively
	- Evaluating and predicting risks

### System Context
= the part of reality that is relevant for the requirements of a system

1. **People** - (groups of) stakeholders
2. **Systems in operation** - other technical systems/hardware
3. **Events** - technical/physical
4. **Processes** - technical/physical/business
5. **Documents** - laws, standards, system documentation
