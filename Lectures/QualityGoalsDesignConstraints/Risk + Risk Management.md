### Managing Risk

- **Close cooperation with project managers:** Provide information concerning risks timely and openly. Propose alternative solutions to meet deadlines
- **Clarify impact of critical requirements:** Prioritization, Costs, Quality
- **Determine risks of architectural decisions
- **VERY RISKY:** Implicit influencing factors and assumptions --> anticipate and address possible implicit assumptions **EXPLICIT NOT IMPLICIT!**
