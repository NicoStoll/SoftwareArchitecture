**Definition:**
- general, reusable solution how to design a (part of a) software system
- high-level
- technology independent

**Categories:**
- [[Adaptable Systems]]
- [[Interactive Systems]]
- [[Mud-to-Structure]]
- [[Distributed Systems]]


***Additional Patterns:***
- *Blackboard:* for problems that cannot be solved by deterministic algorithms but require diverse knowledge
- *Broker:* coordinate communication between providers and consumers in distributed systems
- *Combinator:* for domain object of type T, look for operations which both input and output type T
- *CQRS (Command-Query-Responsibility-Segregation):* Separated read concern from write concerns in  information systems
- *Event-Sourcing:* handle operations on data by a sequence of events recorded in an append-only store
- *Interpreter:* Represent domain object or DSL as syntax. Provide function implementing a semantic interpretation of a domain object separately from the domain object itself
- *Interfacing patterns: Adapter, Facade, Proxy:* Integration of subsystems and/or simplification of dependencies 
- *MVC, MVVM, MV-Update PAC:* Separate presentation from data, services and their coordination
- *SOA (Service Oriented Architecture):* provide abstract services rather than concrete implementations
- *Observer:* asynchronous notifications of consumers
- *Plug-In:* extend the behavior of a component
- *Remove Procedure Call:* remove execution of functions
